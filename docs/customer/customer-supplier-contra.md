If you have a customer who is also a supplier, you may want to offset the outstanding customer
and supplier invoices. This is known as making a contra entry. You can offset the two invoices by
using Customer Contra and Supplier Contra. This means when you record the invoices as being
paid, it doesnâ€™t affect your current bank account balance.

For example:

If you have an outstanding sales invoice for RM200 and a purchase invoice for RM150 for the
same person or company, the actual amount owed to you is RM 50 and the contra entry amount
is RM150.
